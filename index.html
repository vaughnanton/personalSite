			      <h4>Programmers and Music</h4>
			      <p>In the past few months I have had many opportunities of meeting with people who write code for a living. Interestingly enough, I have found that many of these programmers are also talented musicians. Is there a positive correlation between musical and coding ability or are musicians and programmers like mathematicians of a different cognitive ability? Let’s take a moment to explore..<br><br>
               I believe the skill sets of a musician and a programmer have a certain amount of overlap. A computer is like an instrument; it takes input and produces a result.<br><br>
               So how does an instrumentalist make for a great programmer? It is possible the link between programming and music is math. Music is math; numeric relations, octaves, rhythm, timing, frequency multiples, resonance, harmony, and so on. However, it’s not all about math.<br><br>
               Musicians have to focus into their work which contains repetitive technical details – I’ve experienced this firsthand when practicing a piece of music at slow speed for hours on end. The best programmers are able to zoom out and see the big picture, much like an artist has to step back from a painting, or a musician has to produce something that communicates a complete work, not just the technical aspects of it.<br><br>
               Moreover, musicians are generally technically engaged. The instruments (hardware) often interface with other devices (amps, mixers, mutes) to achieve different sounds. Similarly, composers often deal with an array of technologies to get their music written, performed, and produced.<br><br>
               Like code, music is an abstract medium. There is often much more than meets the eye. I find it quite curious that Microsoft named one of their languages C#. This begs the question, has Microsoft observed a correlation between music and code?</p>

			      <h4>Composing Code</h4>
			      <p>“If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.” – Albert Einstein<br><br>
                I would like to use this post to delve into the relationship between music composition and programming. Software design and composition share many parallels. Both involve manipulating and coordinating abstractions, and visualizing their realization. As a violinist and university trained composer, I find that software design is analogous to music composition.<br><br>
                Learning how to play a musical instrument and read music is a wonderful way to keep the mind agile. Learning how to analyze music and compose it is an entirely different ball game.<br><br>
                Armed with the ability to construct rhythm and cohesive sound, I believe composers have a hidden value as software developers. Both composition and coding involve the creative manipulation of abstract concepts with regard to mathematical laws.<br><br>
                Whether writing music, designing a web app or program, much time and mental energy are spent in conceptualizing things that don’t exist. Each design needs to be tested and compared to other alternatives. When the code becomes messy or the sound dissonant, it is time to imagine new solutions or modify current versions until everything becomes whole.<br><br>
                Thinking ahead and proper planning is the name of the game with music composition or creating a web page/software application. In addition, a sensitivity to how one’s work will be received is a factor. If writing code that will be shared or creating an API for others to use, a sense of technique and style can go a long way to making it usable. Are methods named with no regard or notes scribbled on a page? Significant effort is required to attack each project sensibly. This is especially important in UI design.<br><br>
                Fundamentally, music and code are both entirely based on patterns. It’s not so important what instrument or language one uses, rather the ability to discover and exploit purposeful and elegant abstractions and patterns.</p>

			      <h4>Languages behind Digital Music</h4>
			      <p>“Once you free your mind about a concept being correct, true innovation is born.”<br><br>
                I recently stumbled upon some college coursework that I thought I’d share. Rewind to 2014, I was taking a course on advanced analysis for contemporary music. This course involved a study of the diverse range of styles and movements of Western music after 1945; examining critical repertoire through historical context including issues of pitch derivation, formal architecture, and compositional aesthetics.<br><br>
                At the time of my research Daft Punk had just released their album, Random Access Memories. The link between music and programming was more obvious than ever with their use of synthesizers, electronic music, sampling and so on. The song that fired the desire for my research into the topic of digital music can be listened to <a class="modala" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhl-Cs1-sG4">here</a>.<br><br>
                <a class="modala" title="147 Research Paper" href="music147.pdf">Click here</a> to travel through the history of digital music!<br><br>
                To hear the first ever digital music composition mentioned in my research, follow <a class="modala" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFUVR-clo8g">this link</a>. It’s pretty neat to hear a completely computer generated song form the early 60s!</p>

			      <h4>Agile Orchestras</h4>
			      <p>I’m told I’ve been obsessed with music and sound since I was a baby. Growing up playing the violin was my childhood dream come true. From the time I was in elementary school all the way through college, I was always participating in the school orchestra. Recently, I’ve been thinking about how the teamwork involved in an orchestra directly relates to agile software development.<br><br>
               Agile development works by successfully completing one iteration after another with short sprints of work; this requires highly flexible and interactive approaches within the development team. Once the product owner specifies business requirements, the SCRUM master will coordinate with their development team to work through and deliver the product. The scrum master is like the conductor of the orchestra, ensuring the maximum performance from each individual as well as the team as a whole.<br><br>
               If you’ve ever been part of a band or larger musical ensemble, then you know the feeling that rushes over when the music soars and your instrument becomes one with the sound. Imagine for a moment a business that runs like a world-class orchestra, different types of instruments playing different notes and rhythms, in a perfectly timed and synchronized harmony.<br><br>
               Let’s examine how Agile development is synonymous with orchestral performance.<br><br>
               In an orchestra, it’s important that each person knows the repertoire and is highly motivated for success of the group. Inconsistencies will cause dissonance and could derail the entire group, which could lead to catastrophe during a live performance. There also needs to be a level of unspoken cooperation; to ensure the right collection of instruments, play at exactly the right moment, at the perfect volume. If someone is to miss a beat, other members need to instantly adapt and provide support. There is also a sense of commitment which involves months of preparation, rehearsal, and planning. Meeting frequently to construct and share lessons in order to create the perfect project. The conductor’s role is to be a great leader, making sure their team is focused and committed until the last note, producing a flawless performance of beautiful music.<br><br>
               Just like an orchestra on stage, an agile development is highly visible within the organization as the team works in real-time sprints. To ensure a perfect product, the team needs to work in a high degree of unity and coordination, just like an orchestra would for a perfect performance.</p>
